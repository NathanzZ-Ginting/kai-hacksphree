- **Metrics**: Prometheus for monitoring and observability
- **Containerization**: Configured for Docker (implied from prometheus.yml)

## Architecture
  
### Backend Architecture
The backend follows a modular monolith architecture with the following structure:

```
src/
├── modules/
│   ├── authentication/
│   │   ├── controller/
│   │   ├── middleware/
│   │   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── validation/
│   ├── master-data/
│   ├── payment/
│   └── ticketing/
├── db/
│   ├── schema/
│   └── seed.ts
└── index.ts
```

#### Core Modules:
1. **Authentication**: User registration, login, and profile management
2. **Ticketing**: Order management, ticket handling, and booking flows
3. **Master Data**: Management of trains, stations, schedules, and other static data
4. **Payment**: Integration with Midtrans payment gateway

#### Database Schema:
- Users: User accounts with authentication
- Categories: Entity categorization
- Locations & Stations: Geographic data
- Trains & Train Seats: Inventory management
- Schedules: Timetables and routes
- Tickets & Order Tickets: Booking system
- Payments: Transaction tracking
- Timeline: Event tracking

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend uses React with context providers for state management:

- **AuthContext**: Authentication state management
- **BookingContext**: Booking flow management
- **Component Structure**: Organized in layout, pages, and shared components
- **Routing**: React Router with nested routes for services and booking flow

## Technical Challenges Faced

### 1. Integration Complexity
- **Challenge**: Integrating multiple third-party services (Midtrans, Neon database, Prometheus)
- **Solution**: Proper abstraction layers and error handling in service modules

### 2. Real-time Data Consistency
- **Challenge**: Managing seat availability and preventing double bookings
- **Solution**: Database-level constraints and transaction management in order flows

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Challenge**: Ensuring fast response times for schedule searches and booking
- **Solution**: Proper indexing (email, name indices in user table) and efficient query design

### 4. Payment Gateway Integration
- **Challenge**: Securely handling payment processing with Midtrans
- **Solution**: Isolated payment module with proper validation and error handling

### 5. Monitoring and Observability
- **Challenge**: Setting up comprehensive monitoring for a hackathon project
- **Solution**: Prometheus metrics integration with HTTP request tracking and custom metrics

## Impact and Potential Sustainability

### Immediate Impact
- **Digital Transformation**: Modernizes railway ticketing processes
- **User Experience**: Provides intuitive interface for booking and management
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlines operations with real-time data

### Long-term Potential
- **Scalability**: Architecture designed to handle increasing user load
- **Feature Richness**: Modular design allows for easy addition of new services
- **Analytics**: Prometheus integration provides insights for optimization

### Sustainability Aspects
- **Serverless Database**: Neon's serverless PostgreSQL reduces infrastructure costs
- **Modular Design**: Easy maintenance and updates
- **Open Source**: Uses established open-source technologies with strong communities

## Scalability

### Database Scalability
- **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL with potential for connection pooling
- **Indexing Strategy**: Properly indexed tables for fast queries
- **Horizontal Scaling**: PostgreSQL supports replication and partitioning

### Application Scalability
- **Microservice Ready**: Modular architecture can be split into microservices
- **Stateless Design**: Backend is stateless except for authentication tokens
- **CDN Friendly**: Frontend can be deployed on CDN for global access

### Infrastructure Scaling
- **Container Ready**: Architecture supports containerization
- **Auto-scaling**: Can be deployed on platforms with auto-scaling capabilities
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple instances can be load-balanced

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Immediate - 1-2 months)
1. Complete payment integration testing
2. Implement seat availability real-time updates
